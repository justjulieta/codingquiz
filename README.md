# Coding Quiz
Made a simple timed test using Javascript.

## User Story 

As a coding boot camp student, I want to create and successfully take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals. This quiz will also keeo track of high scores in order to compare with fellow classmates.

## Acceptance Criteria

The quiz must have a start button that when clicked by the user, it will trigger a timer and the first question will pop up. There will be multiple questions. However, if the user answers incorrectly, time will be subtracted from the clock.

After all the questions are answered or the time has reaced zero, the game will be over. The high scores will be saved and can be identified by th user's initals which will be automatically asked when the game is done.
